# 🧠 GTSRB – Traffic Sign Recognition using Deep Learning

## 🚗 Overview
This project focuses on **automatic traffic sign recognition** using the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset.  
The goal is to train a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying **43 different types of traffic signs** from real-world images.  

The model was built and trained using **TensorFlow / Keras**, achieving strong classification performance suitable for real-time driver assistance systems or embedded AI applications.
